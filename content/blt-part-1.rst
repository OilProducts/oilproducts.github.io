:summary: Reproducing the Byte Latent Transformer paper at home.  Part one of a series where I try to reproduce and improve upon (lol) the `BLT paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09871>`_

This is the first part of a series of posts where I struggle to read and reproduce a recent paper.  This is currently a placeholder while I collect my thoughts and polish the code for generating the entropy model referenced in the paper.
